Problem:

Various device datasheets and app notes that need to be categorized and sorted.

Should be able to include the following information about the documents:
	- Project used
	- Replacement
	- Comments
	- Recommendations
	- Engineers who have used the device
	- Manufacturer
	- Date
	- Web URL
	- Category
	
Storage should be on a standard file server that is accessible from the LAN.  However, this file structure is READ-ONLY.
All of the above meta-data and link-data is stored in the database (not accessible from the file structure).
The file structure sorts the documents into the following structure:
	
	- Manufacturer
		- Datasheets
		- Application Notes
		- Etc.
		
It would be useful to determine some form of criteria that makes the device "approved" or not.  Generally, most of these
datasheets will be useful, but if the tools becomes good enough, there will be plenty of unuseful or unapproved devices.
This could then be reflected in a new directory structure:

	- Manufactuer
		- Datasheets
			- Good
			- Unknown
		- Application Notes
			- Good
			- Unknown
		- Etc.
